Show the IMDB ranking and titles of a television series.  
Inspired by http://graphtv.kevinformatics.com/ which is currently down with the following message:

> Graph TV is currently offline.  
> Thanks you all for the lovely messages I've received recently. Many of you offered help or just wanted to check to see if I was okay. I want to reassure you all that everything is fine and I'm doing well. I really appreciate the offers and concern! Graph TV has recently been inoperational due to reasons beyond my control. I'll provide updates as soon as I'm able to both on Twitter and in this space.
